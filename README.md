vs-code-dark-theme
==================

_vs-code-dark-theme_ is Intellij color sceheme based on Visual Studio Code Dark theme. 

### Inspiration
I have been Visual Studio Code for last 3 years and got habitual with its color scheme. But, recently I tried Intellij for Golang development, and found it to be superior product. Although it has better performance, I did not it's color scheme. So, I migrated VS Code Dark theme colors to Intellij Dracula theme.

Please note, I migrated it only for Golang syntax only.
